Given input String of combination of the lower and upper case arrange characters in such a way that all lowercase letters should come first.
Example:
Input: "PyNaTive" Output: " aeivyNPT "
Question 2: Given an input string Count all lower case, upper case, digits, and special symbols
Question 3: String characters balance Test
We’ll say that a String s1 and s2 is balanced if all the chars in the string1 are there in s2. characters position doesn’t matter.
Example:
s1 = "yn" s2 = "Pynative" Output: s1 and s2 are balanced True
s1 = "ynf" s2 = "Pynative" Output: s1 and s2 are balanced False
Question 4: Given an input string, count occurrences of all characters within a string
Example:
Input: "pynativepynvepynative"
Output: {'p': 3, 'y': 3, 'n': 3, 'a': 2, 't': 2, 'i': 2, 'v': 3, 'e': 3}
Question 5: Given a list iterate it and count the occurrence of each element and create a dictionary to show the count of each element
For example: list = [10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 40, 50]
Expected Outcome: dict = {10: 2, 20: 2, 30: 1, 40: 1, 50: 1}
